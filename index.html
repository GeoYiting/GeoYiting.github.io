Welcome! I'm a geospatial data scientist with 6+ years' experience in advanced remote sensing, GIS and imaging processing. I'm passionate about using geospatial technologies to solve real-world environmental challenges and bring ecological insight into scalable, cloud-based solutions.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Geography, where I developed data-driven methods to map forest canopy complexity using airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery. Currently, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher, applying machine learning and 3D laser scanning to study forest structure and ecosystem processes across forest sites in the U.S. 

I specialize in: 
- Large-scale environmental data integration 
- LiDAR and multi-/hyper-spectral image analysis 
- GIS-based decision support tools for ecology and sustainability 
- Cloud-based spatial analytics 

Explore my portfolio of research projects, spatial analysis/tools, and data products built with Python, R, GEE, and cloud platforms.
