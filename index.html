Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I recently graduated with my PhD in Geogragphy with a certificate of GIS and spatail analysis. I enjoy all things about remote sensing, GIS and environmental science. This portfolio features some of my professional work and experiences in GIS, LiDAR, and remote sensing.

Check out the **[Portfolio](/portfolio/)** tab to explore my projects.
