I’m a geospatial scientist and remote sensing researcher passionate about solving environmental problems with data and technology.

I earned my Ph.D. in Geography from West Virginia University, where I developed methods to map forest canopy structure and leaf traits using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), hyperspectral data, and NEON field campaigns. I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Virginia, applying those methods to understand how forest architecture and climate interact across diverse ecosystems.

**Skills**:
- Remote Sensing: TLS, airborne LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging, UAVs  
- GIS & Analysis: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Google Earth Engine  
- Programming: Python, R, bash scripting  
- Data: NEON AOP/TOS, climate, species traits, ecological time series  
- Visualization: ggplot2, matplotlib, Leaflet, StoryMaps  

Feel free to reach out for collaborations, data-driven projects, or coffee chats!
