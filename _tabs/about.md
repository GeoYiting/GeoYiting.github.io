I recently completed my Ph.D. in Geography with area of emphasis on GIS, where I developed data-driven methods to quantify forest canopy complexity and ecosystem processes using airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery. Iâ€™m currently a postdoctoral researcher, applying machine learning and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to map forest canopy structure and leaf traits and how they interact with climate across forest sites in the U.S. 

I specialize in: 
- GIS Analysis & decision support tools: ESRI software, QGIS, Google Earth Engine
- Large-scale multi-source environmental data integration 
- LiDAR and multi-/hyper-spectral image analysis 
- Cloud-based spatial analytics Explore my portfolio of research projects, spatial analysis/tools, and data products built with Python, R, GEE, and cloud platforms. 

Feel free to reach out for collaborations, data-driven projects, or coffee chats!
